# Predict Target Group Attacked by Terrorists

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2016 (with annual updates planned for the future). The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 170,000 cases. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland. More information: http://start.umd.edu/gtd/

The GTD data is used to predict the targeted groups victims of terrorist attacks, covering all modelling stages, from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning and imputation to feature selection and classification algorithms for further feature selection and prediction purposes. Evaluating the following machine learning algorithms:

- LogisticRegression
- KNN
- Random Forest 
- LinearSVC
- GradientBoostingClassifier
